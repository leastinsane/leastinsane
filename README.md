# Ah a visitor?

*Welcome and hello, i am @leastinsane, a junior programmer and artist*

</div>

I just started using github and is still trying to figure out everything to be a good engineer, developer, or a helper whether it's in the web or your computer.

## I've slept long enough...
I started to know about github since 2019 (from memes), only created an account (this one) by 2023.
Mostly it was due to Civ VI modding and i am interested in copyin- i mean developing a program or a website to channel my insanity.

## Long since forgotten my name...
Albeit all of this, i am currently interested in anime (artstyle) and has learned to draw in that artstyle.

Learned a bit of copywriting, typography, and UI/UX although i only have a surface understanding as of now, but it is fun indeed.

Also if you have ever seen any of my copypasta in reddit, i am sorry, but that is what makes me alive.

## I'm curious about your skills...
Currently as of now, i am still progressing to learn these languages:
- Python
- C++
- Java
- Javascript

And i'm also looking to learn more about:
- HTML
- CSS
- XML
- Web Developing
- Internet and it's connections in general
- Telecommunications

If you have any learning resources associated to those (if possible, free resources), please do contact me

## Now come forth...
For now, you can contact me via:
- Email: panzerschreksgd@gmail.com
- Reddit: Reddit.com/user/p4nzrekt
